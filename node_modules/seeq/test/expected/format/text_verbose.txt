        anythingslider - Just what the world needs, another jQuery slider. YAWN. I know, check this one out though, it's got lots of cool features.

Here on CSS-Tricks, I've created a number of different sliders. Three, in fact. A "featured content" slider, a "start/stop slider", and "moving boxes". Each of them had some cool interesting feature that I needed to build at the time. All were well-received, but as is the case with these things, people want them to do X, Y, and Z in addition to what they already did.

This new AnythingSlider is an attempt at bringing together the functionality of all of those previous sliders and adding new features. In other words, to create a really "full featured" slider that could be widely useful. This is the first time (on CSS-Tricks) that one of these sliders is an actual plugin as well, which should make implementing it and customizing it much easier.

        YUI Touch Events and Abstractions - The event-touch module extends the whitelist of DOM events to include the native touch and gesture events and adds relevant information to event facades.

The event-move module adds a set of abstract events that adapt to the client environment to handle either touch or mouse input.

The event-flick module adds a "flick" event on top of the gesture abstraction layer to capture a user flicking an element with mouse or finger.

The event-gestures module is a rollup of these three, but will potentially roll in more gesture based events in the future.

        node-png - This is a node.js module, writen in C++, that uses libpng to produce a PNG
image (in memory) from RGB or RGBA buffers.

The module exports three objects: `Png`, `FixedPngStack` and `DynamicPngStack`.

The `Png` object is for creating PNG images from an RGB or RGBA buffer.
The `FixedPngStack` is for joining a number of PNGs together (stacking them
together) on a transparent blackground.
The `DynamicPngStack` is for joining a number of PNGs together in the most
space efficient way (so that the canvas border matches the leftmost upper corner
of some PNG and the rightmost bottom corner of some PNG).

JUTE is a standalone HTTP server that serves your test files to a JUTE backend for testing.
